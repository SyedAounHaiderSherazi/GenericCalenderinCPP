Question 1. Write a C++ function to print the calendar of a given year. The function takes
the year as input. For example,
Note that in this example, the months have been shown in three columns. You can print all
months in just one column depends upon your choice.
Implement (and use) two helper functions for this program:
1. void printMonth(int month): takes number of month as input and print the name of the
month enclosed in three asterisks as shown in the above example. 2. int
getNoOfDaysInMonth(int month, int year): takes month and year as input and returns the
number of days in that month of that particular year.
